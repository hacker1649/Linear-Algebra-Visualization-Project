    "For our creativity we define some Python functions to solve linear systems. The algorithm is known as Gaussian Elimination, which we will simply refer to as **elimination** .  The idea of elimination is to exchange the system we are given with another system that has the same solution, but is much easier to solve.  To this end we will perform a series of steps called **row operations** which preserve the solution of the system while gradually making the solution more accessible.  There are three such operations we may perform.\n",
